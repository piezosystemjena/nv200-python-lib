Introduction
==================================

The NV200 Python library provides a Python interface to control the 
`NV200/D Compact Amplifier <https://www.piezosystem.com/product/nv-200-d-compact-amplifier/>`_  from 
`piezosystem Jena <https://www.piezosystem.com>`_. It supports communication with the device via 
both Ethernet and USB interfaces.

The library offers an asynchronous API using Pythonâ€™s `async` and `await` syntax, enabling integration
with asynchronous applications.

Using an asynchronous interface allows your program to perform other tasks while waiting for the
NV200 device to respond, improving efficiency in applications that handle multiple concurrent operations
or require responsive user interfaces. Additionally, `async / await` makes it easier to communicate
with multiple NV200 devices simultaneously without blocking execution.

For more information on Python's asynchronous programming features, see the 
`official documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html#async-await>`_.

**Key features include:**

- Asynchronous communication based on `aioserial` and `telnetlib3`
- Functions to query and set the device position
- Support for the NV200 :ref:`data recorder <data_recorder>` functionality
- Interface for the NV200 :ref:`waveform generator <waveform_generator>`

This library is intended for users who want to control the NV200/D controller programmatically from Python.
